AKS Infrastructure Provisioning and Docker Image Deployment

This guide provides instructions on how to provision an AKS cluster with Terraform, and build and push a Docker image to an Azure Container Registry using Ansible.

Prerequisites

Install Terraform
Install Azure CLI
Install Ansible
Install Docker
Install the Azure Ansible collection: ansible-galaxy collection install azure.azcollection
Steps

1. Set up Terraform configuration files
Create the following Terraform configuration files:

main.tf: This file contains the AKS and ACR provisioning configuration.


2. Initialize Terraform
Run the following command in the directory containing your Terraform configuration files:


terraform init
This command initializes the backend, downloads the required provider plugins, and sets up the backend for storing the Terraform state.

3. Plan and apply the Terraform configuration
Run the following command to view the planned changes:


terraform plan
Apply the Terraform configuration using the following command:


terraform apply
Confirm the changes by typing yes when prompted. This step provisions the AKS cluster and the Azure Container Registry.

4. Set up the Ansible playbook
Create an Ansible playbook called acr_build.yaml with the content provided in the previous answer. This playbook will build and push a Docker image to the Azure Container Registry.

5. Execute the Ansible playbook
Run the following command to execute the acr_build.yaml playbook:


ansible-playbook acr_build.yaml

This command builds the Docker image using the specified Dockerfile, logs in to the Azure Container Registry, and pushes the built Docker image to the registry.

Summary

By following these steps, you have provisioned an AKS cluster, created an Azure Container Registry, and used Ansible to build and push a Docker image to the registry. You can now deploy your applications to the AKS cluster and use the container images stored in the registry.
